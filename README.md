## Code 201 Reading Notes

This website is going to containe my notes from class readings from the _John Duckett HTML & CSS as well as JavaScript & jQuery_ for code 201.

### 1.

### 2.

### 3. HTML lists, CSS boxes, JS controlflow
  - ordered lists are numbered, ex. instructions on how to build something
  - unordered lists are lists started with a bullet or symbol but have no order to be followed, ex. grocery list
  - defined lists are lists made up of a set of terms followed up by the definitions of those terms
  - you can nest (put inside) lists within other lists 
  - by default css boxes are sized just big enough to hold its content, but that can be manipulated
  - most popular way to manipulate boxes is to adjust them using pixels, percentages, or ems
  - when you use percenatges the size of the box is relative to the browser or relative the the box it is incased in
  - when using ems the size of the box is based on the size of the text within it 
  - you cant use percentages to control border width
  - to center content you can set the left and right margins to auto
  - if else statements let you set two codes one for true and one for fales
  - switch statements have a switch value and a case and in the case there is code that will run if the variable matched the value
  - if you use a data tyoe js did not expect it will try to make sense of the operation instead of sending an error
  - falsy ex.
      -var highscore = false;
      -var highschore = 0;
      -var highschore = ' '
      -var highschore = 10/'score
      -var highschore;
  - truthy ex. 
       -var highschore = true;
       -var highschore = 1;
       -var highschore = 'carrot';
       -var highschore = 10/5;
       -var highschore = 'true';
       -var highschore = '0';
       -var highschore = 'fales';
